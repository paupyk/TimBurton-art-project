                <h3>Tim Burton</h3>
                <h2>Why is Tim Burton the best?</h2>
                <p>Tim Burton has been making movies since the 1980's and continues to make more. Burton is known for his gothic style
                portrayed through his films and collaborations. When he was a pre-teen he made his very first stop-motion short film in
                his backyard. His first icnoic and more recognizable films consist of "Frankeweenie" (1984) and "Pee-
                Wee's Big Adventure" (1985). Some of his other popular works consist of "The Nightmare Before Chrsitmas", "Edward
                Scissorhands", and "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street". His first award of many he received was an Academy
                Award in 1990 for "Beetlejuice".</p>
                <p>It's not often that almost everyone has either heard of or seen someones work. Tim Burton has become such a large name
                across the board when it comes to his own work. He is also known for finding the perfect actors and sets. He is also
                flexiable artist, for example, "Alice in Woderland". Alice is a live action Disney film he worked on and even in live
                time, his iconic style remains. He went from films in his backyard to working with some of the biggest names like
                "Johnny Depp" and "Winona Ryder". Even in his actor choices he remains consistent. Think of movies you saw growing up
                and you may just find you have seen or maybe enjoyed one his works!
